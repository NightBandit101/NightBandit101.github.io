    Chocolate. The eigth wonder of the world! (Or at least it should be.) It's the most delicious thing ever though.
And that is NOT an opinion; it's a fact. Unfortunatley though, some people think that chocolate is bad for your health.
But I am going to explain and prove to all them parents out there why that theory is incorrect with real, good reasons. 
So kids, get ready to lecture/reason to your parents on why chocolate is the best thing that ever happened to the world 
(second only to Wifi). 
    Ok, so chocolate really ISN'T bad for your health. Why you may ask? Well, let me show you with something off of the internet.
    Because everything on the Internet is true, right? Who am I kidding, of COURSE i'm right! Alrighty, here we go...</p> <br>
