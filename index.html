    Chocolate. The eigth wonder of the world! (Or at least it should be.) It's the most delicious thing you've probably ever tasted.
And that is NOT an opinion; it's a fact. Unfortunatley though, some people think that chocolate is bad for your health.
But I am going to explain and prove to all dem parents out there why that theory is incorrect with real, good, hard facts. 
So kids, get ready to lecture and reason to your parents about why chocolate is the best thing that ever happened to the world 
(second only to Wifi) and how you should be allowed to eat IT instead of something your parents tend to force you to eat daily; 
salads.
</p>
        <p>Ok, so chocolate really ISN'T bad for your health. Why you may ask? Well, let me show you with something off of the internet.
Because everything on the Internet is true, right? This is the best, most through andlogical explanation and reasoning to why 
chocolate counts as a salad.</p> <br>
