<p> 


	Football is a team game that is only played in North America by men in college or as a profession. To play, an oval ball with 
	laces is used on a field with lines like a gridiron. But only professional football players in the NFL get paid. Because football is a rough sport and most players have very short careers of it, college football players should also get paid for playing it while they can and for representing their school while they do it. I think that they should get paid because they work and train very hard, maybe not as intensely as NFL players, but enough. Also, their games are just as popular as those of the NFL. College football players absolutely should get paid  because they did all the hard work in the game, the money they would receive would help them and their families and their coaches would pay more attention to individual players.  
	</p>
	<p>College football players should get paid because, the coaches who receive all the money just wrote out the plays while the players themselves put them into action. “Top coaches receive sky-high salaries, and many college athletic departments rake in huge sums. But the players? Zip zero. The way that the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) gets away with not paying the college students is by calling them amateurs or “not professionals” (“Get Paid”). That is not fair because they “sacrifice their bodies all year without receiving any pay, then literally jump for joy, like kids on Christmas, at the thought of a tablet. Meanwhile, their coaches are getting paid $100,000 bonuses-which come on top of multi-million-dollar salaries” (“Get Paid?”). Players pretty much give themselves up for their schools; some injuries that you can get from football could cost you your life. Yet they are willing to take the risk and don’t get paid for it. Therefore, they cannot afford any medical attention when needed. Football is a dangerous sport, period. College football players ignore that and give all they’ve got in a game. Shouldn’t they get paid for it instead of them paying to get on the team? “It is also not fair that players have to put in extra time to keep up with their studies but also have to worry about being able to afford the extras that all students have to buy” (“Top 10 Reasons”). College football players should get paid for playing and representing their schools at the same time. This is one reason why college football players should get paid. 
</p>
<p>College football players should also get paid because, when you’re in college, usually a lot of money is needed for everything; paying the players would not only help them with what they need, it will  help them support their families that worked so hard to get them there. The author of the article “The Case For Paying College Athletes” writes that the NCAA member colleges continue to vote to forbid the sharing of revenues with student athletes. Instead they hide behind  a “veil of amateurism” which not only ensures great wealth for athletic directors and coaches, but also sustained poverty for many of the athletes that provide their labor. “Paying the football players would also help...them adjust to having a job and making money. It is crazy that we ask these students to be celebrities at many of these schools...yet we have no assurance that the players have enough food to eat or clothes to ward off the cold (“Top 10 Reasons”). Put yourself in their shoes; you play football, the second most dangerous sport in America, and you are doing it in college. College, the place you’ve worked all your life to get to, but once you do, you find out that although you are risking your life to play a sport that you are great at, that takes up almost all of your time, and representing your beloved school at the same time, you are not getting paid. Now, this might not sound like a big deal, but it is! Playing football for a college takes a lot of skill and practice. Almost every day a player can be seen training or working out. And with the little free time they get, they are at celebrations or studying and doing homework. They don’t have time to have any type of job. As much as they might need the one, they can’t get it because they are too busy playing football or attending the causes of playing football. You’re probably thinking, “Well, just quit the team then! if it’s giving them that much trouble.” But they can’t do that either because, if they quit the team, then they’d lose the scholarship that was given to them because of being on the team. And they would then either be forced to drop out of the college entirely or find an incredibly well-paying job in a short period of time that would give them pay enough to cover all of the college expenses. Because they can’t depend on their family to pay for their everything for their entire lives. “Also, if college players received decent middle-class wages, many players would be able to send some money home, which would in turn encourage many parents to convince their sons to stay in school” (“Top 10 Reasons”). Now you can see how paying college football players would not only help them, but their families as well. 

<p> Some people think that it would be too complicated to figure out how much to pay each player, but actually it wouldn’t be because the coaches should know enough about each player to figure it out. After all, aren’t the coaches already being paid sky-high salaries for knowing things like that? Yup! Besides, the people that are issuing that statement aren’t even the ones who would be involved in that kind of a meeting. It may sound like a lot of work to them, but if you actually take the time to sit and think about it, (which, I dare say that probably nobody does) it isn’t because, after watching each player play practically every practice or, in this case, day, they know (or should know) about the skill, strength, and weakness of each player and who plays well or who does not. But someone who is against paying the players for this reason might also bring up the question of “So, should a college football player who doesn't play on TV be paid the same amount as one competing in the national championship?” (“Shouldn’t”) Well, that’s sort of a common sense thing. I mean, the great coaches (or so people say) should easily be able to figure something like that out. But then the person/people might say that, “If they want to be paid, they should just get into the NFL, because each player can earn a 4-year contract” (“Shouldn’t”). OK, first of all, it’s not that easy to get into the NFL. Only 256 out of 15,588 students/people get into the NFL. That means that not many people that try out get on any teams. Second, to do so they have to be 3 years out of high school to even be able to try out for the team. So, if they were to quit their college football team, then they would have to train even harder, and be three years into college AND have an incredibly slim chance of even making it onto a team. This whole process, though, would be unnecessary if the student athletes would get paid. The college team would stay good, the players would have a better life and they would be able to finish their education without worry about their future. The only people who would be slightly bothered would be the coaches, because they are the ones who would give all of the information to the only other people who would be slightly bothered by this; whoever is going to pay the student athletes. So, as you can now see, paying the players is probably the most sensible thing to do. 
 </p>
 <p>So, as it was stated before, because football is a rough sport and most players have very short careers of it, college football players should also get paid for playing it while they can and for representing their school while they do it. One reason why this should be so is because the coaches who receive all the money just wrote out the plays while the players themselves put them into action. They did all of the dirty work, literally. Also, college is pretty much the goal of life right? An it’s very expensive too. Therefore, another reason why college football players should get paid is because, when you’re in college, usually a lot of money is needed for everything; paying the players would not only help them with what they need, it will  help them support their families that worked so hard to get them there. And finally, because it’s not easy to get into the NFL, paying the players would help them decide to stay in college and continue to play the sport and represent their team at the same time. So the next time you are screaming in the stands in a college football game, stop your screaming for a moment and take the time to think about how good each player is, about all of the sacrifices they are making to be where they are at that moment, and about how they are not getting paid for it.
